# Hallpass Toolbox

**Toolbox by Hallpass** is a set of utilities developed and maintained by [Hallpass and Friends](https://academy.hallpassandfriends.com).  We built this set of tools to enhance our development environment.



## Features

### Templating

The Templating tool allows you to easily create a set of templates to "scaffold" your development.

A template a set of files, and optionally a set of customization fields. For example, 
if you are building a web project, you might want to create a template for a new page that consists of HTML, CSS and JS files.

We use the Templating tool to scaffold new "pages" in our NextJS projects and "views" in our Angular projects.
